        <H1>Happy Teacher's Day</H1>
        <p> You’re my favorite teacher,
            <br>
this is obvious and clear.
            <br>
When I’m in your class,
            <br>
I open my ear.
<br>
            <br>
You encourage me,
            <br>
to learn and create.
            <br>
Your teaching style,
            <br>
is a wonderful trait.
            <br>
<br>
I’m really glad,
            <br>
that we do get along.
            <br>
You don’t criticize me,
            <br>
when I get things wrong.
            <br>
            <br>

You’re one of those teachers,
            <br>
always helpful and warm.
            <br>
Inside the classroom,
            <br>
you can calm any storm.
            <br>
<br>
You’re my favorite teacher,
            <br>
this is obvious and clear.
            <br>
I hope and I pray,
            <br>
you’ll be my teacher next year.
            <br>
